**Chisels & Bits 2** is an unfinished mod that was made after AlgorithmX2 stopped developing the original Chisels & Bits mod. However, C&B2 was never finished and eventually OrionOnline stepped in to continue development of the original mod.

So, if you want to play Chisels & Bits on modern versions of Minecraft, please have a look at the [original repository](https://github.com/ChiselsAndBits/Chisels-and-Bits) or join the [official discord](https://discord.chisels-and-bits.com/).
